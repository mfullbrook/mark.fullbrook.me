## Hardware
* My current Mac is the 2019 16" MacBook Pro, with 8-core i9 and 32GB memory. Previously, my workhorse was mid-2012 MacBook Pro Retina, quad-core 2.6GHz i7 with 16GB memory.
* My main screen is a Dell U2715H.  It's not 4K but actually has more screen real estate being QHD.
* I have my laptop to the side of the Dell screen, sitting on a [Twelve South Curve](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/HLST2ZM/A/twelve-south-curve-stand-for-macbook).
* For years I swore by the compact Apple Magic Keyboard, but recently I switched up to the full version.  It was nothing to do with the only one being available in [space grey](https://www.johnlewis.com/apple-magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-2017-british-english-space-grey/p3539841) ðŸ™ˆ
* I've also got the matching Magic Trackpad but it's not as good as the trackpad on the laptop, and doesn't come close to [Logitech's MX Master mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/mx-master-business).
* Pluggable's [mini USB-C docking station](https://plugable.com/products/ud-cam) keeps things neat, however I wouldn't recommend it and next time will invest a bit more for CalDigit's TS3.

## Editors and Terminal
* When working on JavaScript projects I use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), if it's PHP then [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) and for dabbling in Python PyCharms.  Yes, I love an IDE.  The additional code insight the JetBrains tools brings is unparalleled.
* For me, a critical addon for IntelliJ products is the [Material Theme UI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui).  It makes the IDE beautiful.  I use the Material Oceanic theme in PhpStorm and Material Darker theme in WebStorm.
* My goto editor for small projects is VSCode.  VSCode is good, but I've lost too many hours fighting with ESlint and VScode settings that it's tarnished our relationship.
* My terminal is [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with a custom zsh setup forked from [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and using the awesome [starship prompt](https://starship.rs/).  My most used and highly recommended shell productivity tools is [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) check it out!

## Desktop Apps
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) is an excellent git UI.  The [conflict resolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1iWJNyRpQE) is worth the price alone!
* For many years I loved Sequel Pro, but have switched to [Table Plus](https://tableplus.com/) and haven't looked back.
* For wireframing, UI design or vector work I used [Sketch]().
* Unashamed heavy user of Microsoft's Office 365 suite - it's hard to beat these days!
* Alfred 4 (search), Magnet (window manager), BarTender (menu manager), [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) programming documentation, [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) (calendar). Lunar (screen brightness), Bear (notes) and 1Password are my productivity apps.

## SaaS
* Miro
* FrontApp
* Clubhouse
* ClickUp


## Furniture
* In the home office we have the beautiful [Ginsberk Desk in conker brown](https://www.swooneditions.com/ginsberg-mid-century-conker-desk) from Swoon Editions.  At work I have a [Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk](https://www.fully.com/en-gb/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html)
* When working at home I seem to get up and move around less and was feeling the strain of a bad chair.  So, I invested in a (refurbished) [Steelcase Leap V2](https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/leap/). I highly recommend [CorporateSpec](https://corporatespec.com/) to get a bargain on refurbished chairs.
